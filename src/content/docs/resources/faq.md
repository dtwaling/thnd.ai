## What is THND?
THND is a utility token that grants a license to access NΞXUS (Omni Trader), an AI‑assisted crypto trading platform. The platform focuses on disciplined, automated portfolio management rather than “degen” gambling. You keep control of your funds and keys at all times. THND is not an investment; it is access.

## Who created THND?
THND/NΞXUS was built by a team of crypto veterans with long experience in automated trading, AI, and large‑scale software systems.

## What makes NΞXUS (the THND AI Trader) different?
- User‑controlled funds and keys: You can view your private keys, audit balances, and withdraw at any time.
- Practical automation: Automated buy/sell flows, DCA, and stables rotation targeted at steady growth and risk control.
- Transparent ops: In‑app audits, explicit fees, visible withdrawal flows, and clear logs.
- Telegram‑native UX: Trade, review positions, export reports, and manage withdrawals without leaving Telegram.

## Contract address
`0x7567d006f6be77E3D87Aa831855CB4102E37b17D`

## What are the benefits of holding THND?
Holding THND unlocks platform access and additional benefits:
- Platform access: Use the full AI Trader feature set with eligible holdings (see Access below).
- Community perks: Priority features, early betas, potential rewards, and NFT drops announced via the community.
- License model: No recurring subscription; access is gated by your holdings.

Details and thresholds are below.

## Tokenomics
- Max supply: 300 tokens (“Three Hundred”).
- Burn: 3% of every transfer is permanently burned (true burn; no marketing wallet).
- Liquidity: Locked for 300 months.
- Result: Deflationary supply over time.

## How do I get THND?
- Exchange: Click “Buy” on Dextools or another DEX to purchase via a supported exchange.

*Tip:* For larger purchases (≈1 THND or more), breaking the purchase into smaller ammounts (i.e. 0.25 at a time) is recommended to minimize slippage.

## How do I gain access to the AI Trader?
Two ways to qualify:
- Hold 0.97 $THND: Full access, including the Layer One trader.
- Hold 10 Azuki Apes: Access to Layer One, with limited pairs and features.

Link your wallet in the Telegram bot to validate holdings. There are no recurring subscription fees; access is token‑gated.

## What exactly is the AI Trader (NΞXUS)?
NΞXUS is an AI‑assisted trading system that continuously evaluates markets and helps manage your portfolio. You operate it via Telegram with inline buttons and commands.

Core capabilities:
- Automated trading flows
  - AI Buyer Mode: Automated buys.
  - Auto‑Manage: Automated sells, DCA, and double‑down logic.
  - Stables Rotation: Rotate between stables and majors (e.g., ETH) based on market forecasts.
- Risk and ops
  - Contract analysis: Paste a contract address for an at‑a‑glance read on risk, hold profile, and expected time horizon.
  - Portfolio oversight: Unified wallet summary, positions, P/L, holdings refresh, and per‑user audit tools.
  - Withdrawals: Request USDC Layer One withdrawals with a structured wait/penalty model; completion messages include a “View Transaction” link.
- Quality of life
  - Telegram inline actions for trading, exporting reports, viewing wallets, linking addresses, and more.
  - Admin tooling (for operators) to audit, reconcile, and manage edge cases without impacting uptime.

*Note:* Some features are in active beta/alpha. Expect fast iteration and frequent improvements.

## What is NΞXUS (vision)?
“NΞXUS” is the umbrella for the trader’s research loop: scanning tokens frequently (e.g., every 60 seconds), blending heuristics, technical indicators, and sentiment signals to drive automation and alerts.

## How much does the AI Trader cost?
There is no subscription. Access is gated by holdings:
- 0.97 $THND → Full platform access (including Layer One).

Transfers of THND incur the token’s 3% burn as described in Tokenomics.

## What are the current features?
- AI Buyer Mode (automated buys)
- Auto‑Manage (automated sells, DCA, double‑down)
- Contract analysis on pasted addresses
- Portfolio summary, wallet linking, export, and audit tools
- Layer One USDC withdrawals with explicit wait/penalty and Solscan “View Transaction” links

## Is there revenue sharing?
The community operates a revenue‑sharing model aligned with holdings. Specific percentages, eligibility windows, and distribution details are communicated in the official channels and may evolve as the system matures.

## Is the platform custodial?
Keys are user‑controlled. The bot can provision wallets you can inspect (including private keys) and withdraw from. Your balances and withdrawals are visible in‑app, and you can export reports for independent reconciliation.

## Is this financial advice?
No. THND is a license token for platform access. The trader provides tools and automation; markets carry risk. Use your own judgment and manage risk accordingly.
